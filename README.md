1)Transform the image in the +x direction by 25%, and create an image:

  * Read an image using opencv
  * Create a function with image will converted into float and put shape(Width first then Height)
  * Use warpaffine function to implement simple remapping.
  * Then save an image

 5)From the center of the image, in all directions, increase the RGB values of the pixels in a manner that, each pixel from the center, the percentage drops by 1%. 
 i.e. the center pixel's RGB will increase by 50%, and the next pixels in x and y directions will be 49%. This goes on and on until the increase becomes 0 %.
 
 Result:Incomplete (I apologize for that,i try it,but not understand in properway.)
